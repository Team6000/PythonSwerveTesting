## What to install (Windows, Mac or Linux)
- Git: https://git-scm.com/downloads
- Python 3.13: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3131/ (also fine to get it automatically using Anaconda or PyCharm)
- PyCharm: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/ (bottom of the page is free Community Edition, it will suffice here)
- Elastic Dashboard (likely replacement for FRC Shuffleboard): https://github.com/Gold872/elastic-dashboard/releases
- PathPlanner (we still prefer it to Choreo, see video 13 on team's YouTube): https://github.com/mjansen4857/pathplanner/releases

## Additional things to install (Windows, Mac or Linux)
If you want to troubleshoot a real (not simulated) robot, you will need Outline Viewer and/or AdvantageScope:
 - they are now a part of official WPILib: https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/releases/

If you want to drive a real (not simulated) robot, it's Windows-only: 
 - download Driver Station (part of NI Game Tools): https://www.ni.com/en/support/downloads/drivers/download.frc-game-tools.html
