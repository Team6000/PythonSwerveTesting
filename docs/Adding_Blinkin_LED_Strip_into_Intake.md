# LED strip as a part of Intake (light up when it has gamepiece)

Assuming you already have an intake similar to our [Intake Examples](Adding_Intake.md) , this is what you need:


### this code goes to `subsystems/ledstrip.py`

```python

from wpilib import Spark
from commands2 import Subsystem

class LedStrip(Subsystem):
    def __init__(self, pwmChannel: int) -> None:
        super().__init__()
        self.blinkin = Spark(pwmChannel)

    def selectColor(self, color: float) -> None:
        """
        :param color: between -1.0 and +1.0, see page 8 in Rev Blinkin manual
        (https://www.revrobotics.com/content/docs/REV-11-1105-UM.pdf)
        """
        self.blinkin.set(color)

```


### this goes to `__init__` function of `subsystems/intake.py`

```python3

    def __init__(self):

        # ...

        # add LED strip
        from subsystems.ledstrip import LedStrip
        self.ledStrip = LedStrip(pwmChannel=1)  # if your LED strip is plugged into RoboRIO PWM channel 1

        # ...

```

### this goes to the end of `periodic` function of `subsystems/intake.py` (if such function was missing, add it first)

```python3

     def periodic(self):
        # ...

        if self.isGamepieceInside():
            self.ledStrip.selectColor(0.87)   # blue color
            # (other colors are on manual page 14-17 : https://www.revrobotics.com/content/docs/REV-11-1105-UM.pdf )
        else:
            self.ledStrip.selectColor(0)  # no color

        # ...

```
